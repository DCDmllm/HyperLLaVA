## üéì HyperLLaVA Overview

Momentor is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for effectively enhancing performance on downstream multimodal tasks. It is composed of a Visual Expert-Assisted Projector and a  Language Expert-integrated Tuning module. The architecture of the proposed HyperLLaVA is shown in the following figure.

Code will be available soon.
